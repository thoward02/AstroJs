# AstroJs
My little brother wanted an asteroid-esque game to run on his Pi for a school project so I built this C:

# Install // Running it 

If you just want to run it on your computer, download the repository and run /source/main.html
Or you can just go to http://thoward02.github.io/AstroJs

If you want to run it with electron, you can download it, and run `npm install` and `npm start` in your local command prompt C:
*Do note you do need node.js installed if you want to run it in electron, but again there isn't much of a reason to run it in electron if you already have a browser installed*
